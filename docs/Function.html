    <h1>Function</h1>
    <p>
        A function is a way to create reusable pieces of code that can have variables inputted into.
        Python has hundreds of functions built-in, a couple example include <code>print()</code> and <code>sort()</code>.
        You can also write your own functions in Python to add your own reusable operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Defining Functions</h2>

    <p>
        Let's define our own function in Python. 
        First, think of a easy name to remember and one that won't conflict with built-in functions.
        Next, you'll want to type in <code>def</code> and then the function name along with a set of parenthesis and a colon that end.
        Finally create a new indented line and start writing code!
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <md-block>
        ``` py
        def myFunction(): # Define function
            print("It works!")
            return

        myFunction() # Call function later
        ```
    </md-block>

    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>
        In Python, you can also create functions that take variables as an input.
        You can use this to write a long piece of code once and use it anywhere easily.
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>
        Here's an example of a very basic logging function, which takes a message and a severity number:
    </p>

    <md-block>
        ``` py
        def log(message, severity=0):
            severityLevels = ["Info", "Warn", "Error"]
            print(f"[{severityLevels[severity]}] {message}")

        log("Logging works!", 0)
        ```
    </md-block>
